# Electric Bus Analysis

##
This repository contains a jupyter notebook file with an analysis of the number of electric buses in use for schools in the contiguous United States
as of June 2022.  To access the Jupyter Notebook, simply click on the "Electric Bus Analysis" in the main.  The dataset was collected and created by the World Resources Institute.  

## Tools
The analysis was completed in python using pandas, geopandas, numpy.    

## Inspiration
I did this analysis because I was curious how many and which type of schools have been investing in electric buses.  As a three season high school coach I have
spent more time on busses than most people and would love to see more electric buses committed in the years to come.
